              <p>
                Christopher Martini's first entry into the film industry was as
                a child actor on a Feature Film for HBO, acting opposite John
                Lithgow. Chris fell in love with cinema after watching the films
                of Bergman, Fellini, Kurosawa and Welles. As early as high
                school, he was directing and shooting his own Hi8 movies, and
                editing them on VHS.
              </p>

              <p>
                After high school, Chris landed a job as an apprentice editor,
                on a movie of the week for ABC, editing on 35mm film. Shortly
                after, he was accepted to NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts Film
                School on scholarship and offered a job as a teacher’s assistant
                in the editing department. In 1996, Chris graduated from NYU,
                and worked as a camera assistant, sound man, eventually settling
                into editing, working steadily for over fifteen years. He is a
                member of IATSE Local 700 (Editor’s Guild).
              </p>

              <p>
                But while working in film and television, Chris never gave up on
                his directing path.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chris’ short film, “The Stone Child,” about a Lakota Native
                American boy coming of age on the reservation, played at over 25
                U.S. film festivals, winning Channel 13’s Reel Shorts contest,
                and was broadcast on PBS. “The Stone Child” was filmed on
                Super16mm, in 18-degree weather, in the Badlands of South
                Dakota, and involved non-professional Native American actors,
                and a herd of wild buffalo.

              <p>
                Chris’ first feature film, “Trooper,” about a returning Iraq War
                veteran, earned Chris the “Renaissance Man Award” at the 2011
                Garden State Film Festival, as well as garnering the musical
                support of Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan. Chris was the
                writer, director, and star. The film received a glowing review
                in The Huffington Post, by Joshua Kors, award-winning journalist
                of veteran’s issues. “Trooper” received theatrical distribution
                through AAFES (Army & Air Force Exchange Service), Cinema on
                Demand, and is currently available on multiple streaming
                platforms worldwide.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chris directed the feature film, "What The Night Can Do,"
                written by Emmy Award Winner, Stuart Margolin "The Rockford
                Files" "Days of Heaven," and starring Stuart, Oscar Nominated
                JoBeth Williams "Poltergeist", Mercedes Mason "Fear of the
                Walking Dead," Max Martini "Captain Phillips", and Peyton
                Kennedy "Everything Sucks." "What The Night Can Do" was filmed
                on location in West Virginia, and was distributed worldwide by
                ITN.

              <p>
                ​​“Pastalight”, Chris’ award-winning comedy short, won Best
                Short Film at Montana and Maui International Film Festivals,
                and  was distributed on Alaska Airlines Inflight Entertainment.

                Chris recently wrapped shooting, directing and editing, a
                documentary on Patriot artist and activist, Scott Lobaido. The
                film stars Lobaido, Rudy Giuliani, and Curtis Sliwa, and is
                Executive Produced by Global Ascension Studios (“Rush Hour”

                In 2023, Chris, along with his wife, Liz, established an art
                therapy program for Veterans, at Art Therapy Dallas, in Dallas,
                TX, where Veterans can deal with their trauma, through art.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chris is a dual citizen (Italy), and the owner of Triple Martini

                Aidan, and their pitbull, Stella. He is excited about being a
                father, future projects, his new skillset of being a combination
                director and cinematographer, and the power of cinema to change
                lives.
