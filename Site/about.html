              <p>
                Christopher Martini's first entry into the film industry was as
                a child actor on a Feature Film for HBO, acting opposite John
                Lithgow. Chris fell in love with cinema after watching the films
                of Bergman, Kurosawa and Welles. As early as high school, he was
                directing and shooting his own Hi8 movies, and editing them on
                VHS.
              </p>

              <p>
                After high school, Chris landed a job as an apprentice editor,
                on a movie of the week for ABC, editing on 35mm film. He was
                accepted to NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts Film School on
                scholarship and offered a job as a teacher’s assistant in the
                editing department. In 1996, Chris graduated from NYU, and
                worked as a camera assistant, sound man, eventually settling
                into editing, working steadily for over fifteen years. He is a
                member of IATSE Local 700 (Editor’s Guild).
              </p>

              <p>While working, Chris never gave up on his directing path.</p>

                Chris’ short film, “The Stone Child,” about a Lakota Native
                American boy coming of age on the reservation, played at over 25
                U.S. film festivals, winning Channel 13’s Reel Shorts contest,
                and was broadcast on PBS. “The Stone Child” was filmed on
                Super16mm, in 18-degree weather, in the Badlands of South
                Dakota, and involved non-professional Native American actors,
                and a herd of wild buffalo.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chris’ first feature film, “Trooper,” about a returning Iraq War
                veteran, earned Chris the “Renaissance Man Award” at the 2011
                Garden State Film Festival, as well as garnering the musical
                support of Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan. Chris was the
                writer, director, and star. The film received a glowing review
                in The Huffington Post, by Joshua Kors, award-winning journalist
                of veteran’s issues. “Trooper” received theatrical distribution
                through AAFES (Army & Air Force Exchange Service), Cinema on
                Demand, and is currently available on multiple streaming
                platforms worldwide.

                Chris is the owner of Triple Martini Productions, Inc. He lives
                with his wife, Liz, their son, Aidan, and their pitbull, Stella.
                He is excited about being a father, future projects, and
                expanding his skillset into cinematography, becoming a
                combination director and cinematographer.
