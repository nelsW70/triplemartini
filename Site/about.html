						<p>Christopher Martini’s first entry into the industry was as a child actor on a Feature Film for HBO,
              acting opposite John Lithgow, in a scene described by the actor, at the AFI, as being one of the most
              memorable in his career. In 1996, Chris graduated from NYU film school (notable alumni include Woody Allen,
              Martin Scorsese, and Ang Lee).</p>

						<p>Chris’ short film, “The Stone Child,” about a Lakota Native American boy coming of age on the reservation,
              played at over 25 U.S. film festivals, winning Channel 13’s Reel Shorts contest, and was broadcast on PBS.
              “The Stone Child” was filmed on Super16mm, in 18-degree weather, in the Badlands of South Dakota, and involved
              non-professional Native American actors, and a herd of wild buffalo.</p>

            <p>Chris’ first feature film, “Trooper,” about a returning Iraq War veteran, earned Chris the “Renaissance Man Award”
              at the 2011 Garden State Film Festival, as well as garnering the musical support of Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan.
              Chris was the writer, director, and star. The film received a glowing review in The Huffington Post, by Joshua Kors,
              award-winning journalist of veterans issues. “Trooper” was picked up for distribution and is available on iTunes,
              Amazon, Xbox, Sony PlayStation, VOD across North America.

            <p>In 2013, Chris was honored with the job of producing “Luanda-Kinshasa,” a grand art installation video for renowned
              Vancouver artist, Stan Douglas, and Co-Executive Produced by Douglas and David Zwirner, the David Zwirner gallery in
              NYC, one of the top art galleries in the world, representing other artists such as Jeff Koons and R. Crumb. The video
              features famed jazz musician, Jason Moran (winner of the MacArthur Genius Grant), and paid homage to Jean-Luc Goddard’s
              “Sympathy For The Devil.” A fictional re-creation of a Miles Davis recording session at “The Church,” the shoot involved
              70’s period set construction, instruments, costumes, and hair. The installation video went on to receive glowing reviews
              in the New York Times, the Village Voice, and The Guardian, where art critic, Jason Farago, named it the #8 art show in the
              U.S. in 2014. “Luanda” was nominated for two International Association of Art Critics Awards, “Best Time-Based Format,” and
              “Best Show in a Commercial Space in New York,” in 2014. The video has exhibited in major museums all over the world.

              of Grey”, and Peyton Kennedy “American Fable.” “What The Night Can Do” was filmed on location in West Virginia.
